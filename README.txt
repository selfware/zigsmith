A collection of Zig build scripts and wrapper libraries that make it easy to
use C and C++ projects with Zig.

Adding a zigsmith package to your project
-----------------------------------------

Packages in zigsmith are organized by their first two letters to make browsing
easier. For example, the "zlib" package can be found in the `z/l` directory.

To add a package to your project:

1. Browse to [our website](https://zigsmith.com) and search for the package by
   its name

1. Select the specific version and/or hash you'd like to use

1. Add the package to your project using the provided link, just like you would
   any other dependency
