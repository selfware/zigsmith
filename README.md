# zigsmith

A collection of C and C++ packages ported to use the Zig build system. All
packages currently target 0.14.0.

## Adding a zigsmith package to your project

Packages in zigsmith are organized by their first two letters to make browsing
easier. For example, the "zlib" package would be found in the `z/l` directory.

To add a package to your project:

1. Browse to https://zigsmith.com and search for the package by its name

1. Select the specific version and hash (the first hash is the latest and
recommended package)

1. Add the package to your project using the provided link, just like you would
   any other dependency
